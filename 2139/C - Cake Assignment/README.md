Today, the manager of a cake shop gave them a total of $$$2^{k+1}$$$ cakes. The cakes were distributed evenly, so each of them initially received $$$2^k$$$ cakes.</p><p>However, Chocola and Vanilla now want to redistribute the cakes such that Chocola ends up with exactly $$$x$$$ cakes and Vanilla gets the remaining $$$2^{k+1}-x$$$ cakes.</p><p>In one step, they can perform exactly one of the following two operations: </p><ol> <li> Chocola gives half of her cakes to Vanilla. This operation is only allowed if Chocola currently has an even number of cakes. </li><li> Vanilla gives half of her cakes to Chocola. This operation is only allowed if Vanilla currently has an even number of cakes. </li></ol><p>Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach the target distribution and to output any valid sequence of operations achieving that minimum.</p><p>It can be proven that, under the given constraints, a valid solution always exists, and the minimum number of steps required is at most $$$120$$$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.
